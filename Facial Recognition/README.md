# Facial Recognition Based on User Input

This program uses pillow, Py/Tesseract, OpenCV and Kraken to recognize text and faces.
The user inputs a word to the program.
The program then takes this string and if an image has that word somewhere in it, the programs returns a contact sheet
of all of detectable faces within the image. The program is currently set to iterate through a 200mb zipfile containing screenshots of newspapers.
