# Search Algorithm Visualizer

This Python script runs a search algorithm with live graph traversal updates based on a graph created in a text file. The graph, maze.txt, is made up of:

- 1 for obstacles
- 0 for paths
- 2 for goals

## Types of search algorithms

Currently the script can visualize:

- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
